### STEP 1 - Build a simple reducer and initial state

- In a folder called `reducers` add a reducer file and build out a simple reducer with just a default return for now
- In the same file, build your initial state object that has a list of todos with the following shape:

```js
{
  item: 'Learn about reducers',
  completed: false,
  id: 3892987589
}
```

- Export both the reducer and the initial state object

### STEP 2 - Set up state in your component

You get to choose how you want to set up your components. Please don't just do this all inside App. I know it is a small and simple project, but you will do yourself a great service by setting your app up as if it were going to be a larger application

- Using the `reducer` hook, set up state in your component. Think about what you'll need in order to use the reducer hook, and think about what it returns.
- Now render your list of todos from your reducer in your app

### STEP 3 - Adding todos

- Build a form to add todos to your list
- Build a function that will dispatch an action to add a new todo
- Write the `case` in your reducer for adding a todo (You can create a unique id with `new Date()`)

### STEP 4 - Toggle the completed field

- Build a function that will dispatch an action to toggle a todo's completed field
- Invoke this new function when you click on a todo
- Style your todo to somehow show that it is completed (be creative here!)
- Write the `case` in your reducer for toggling the completed property

### STEP 5 - Clearing completed todos

- Build a function that will dispatch an action to filter out any completed todos
- Invoke this new function when you click on a "Clear completed" button
- Write the `case` in your reducer for filtering completed todos
